             <p>Leh (/ˈleɪ/)[2] is a city in Indian-administered Ladakh in the disputed Kashmir region.[3] It is the largest city and the joint capital of Ladakh.[4] It has been the capital of Ladakh since the Medieval Period.[4] Leh, located in the Leh district, was also the historical capital of the Kingdom of Ladakh. The seat of the kingdom, Leh Palace, the former residence of the royal family of Ladakh, was built in the same style and about the same time as the Potala Palace in Tibet.[citation needed] Since they were both constructed in a similar style and at roughly the same time, the Potala Palace in Tibet and Leh Palace, the royal residence, are frequently contrasted. Leh is at an altitude of 3,524 m (11,562 ft), and is connected via National Highway 1 to Srinagar in the southwest and to Manali in the south via the Leh-Manali Highway (part of National Highway 3).

Leh-Ladakh, a union territory in northern India, is a region renowned for its stunning mountainous landscapes, ancient monasteries, and unique Tibetan culture. It's characterized by high-altitude deserts, dramatic mountain ranges like the Himalayas and Karakoram, and deep river valleys. The region is a popular destination for adventure tourism and cultural exploration, offering activities like trekking, river rafting, and visits to historical sites. </p>

            <h3>Pangong Lake</h3>
            <img src="./pangong lake.jpg">
            <p>Pangong Tso, also known as Pangong Lake, is a high-altitude, endorheic (landlocked) lake located in the Himalayas, at a height of approximately 4,350 meters (14,270 ft). It stretches 134 km long and extends from Ladakh (India) into Tibet (China), with about 60% of its length situated in Tibet. The lake is known for its stunning beauty, with its brackish water changing colors from blue to green to red depending on the sunlight and weather conditions. </p>

               <p>Manali (Hindi: manālī, pronounced [mənaːliː]) is a resort town, near Kullu town in Kullu district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh.[2] It is situated at the northern end of the Kullu Valley, formed by the Beas River. The town is located in the Kullu district, approximately 270 kilometres (170 mi) north of the state capital of Shimla and 544 kilometres (338 mi) northeast of the national capital of New Delhi. Manali is a popular tourist destination in India and serves as the gateway to the Lahaul and Spiti district as well as the city of Leh in Ladakh.[3]

Manali is the beginning of an ancient trade route through Lahaul (H.P.) and Ladakh, over the Karakoram Pass and onto Yarkand and Hotan in the Tarim Basin of China.

As per the 2011 Census of India, Manali Municipal Council had a population of 8,096, comprising 4,717 males and 3,379 females. Updated estimates suggest the town’s population is approximately 11,700 as of 2025.[4]

During the summer 2025 monsoon season, heavy rainfall triggered multiple landslides in Mandi district, disrupting the Chandigarh–Manali highway near 4 Mile, Pandoh, and Thalot Tunnel. The route was blocked for up to 24 hours, stranding hundreds of vehicles and causing significant travel delays.[5] Statewide, over 400 roads were blocked; Mandi alone reported 232 blocked roads and 71 in Kullu district, including Manali-bound routes[6]. The disasters resulted in 137 deaths, with severe damage to roads, water and power

infrastructure.[7]

Due to the narrow Himalayan terrain and recent landslides, traffic congestion along the Chandigarh–Manali National Highway (NH‑21) has worsened significantly. Even outside disaster periods, gridlock is common during peak tourist season, leading to long delays and often only one-way traffic management on affected stretches.[8]</p>

                <p>Flowing down from Mount Everest, the river is believed to be the highest navigable whitewater. As such, it came to the attention of teams participating in the world cup since Austrian paddlers made a world record descending from 3,200 m altitude in France. Czechoslovak sportsmen then agreed to take up the challenge. A team of sixteen men, including fourteen Czechs and two Slovaks, had been gathered and on 4 January 1973 they set on the journey from Děhylov by cars (notably using customized Tatra 138 that had to survive over 30,000 km forth and back). For the last part from Lukla to Pheriche, 110 porters were hired to carry the boats and other equipment. The actual river trip began on 1 April near Pheriche at 4,243 mamsl and ran for 126 km down to Sun Kosi. The paddlers used both covered tandem canoes (C2) of Vertex brand and solo kayaks (K1), all made of fiberglass. The expedition returned home safely in August the same year.[10]

Three years later, in 1976, there was a British expedition of seven kayakers under the leadership of Mike Jones. They used 4 metres long fiberglass slalom-style kayaks specially designed by Pyranha Canoes with extra buoyancy and reinforcement. The expedition is notable for taking place in September to avoid ice and when the water was high to set new altitude record. They paddled at approximately 5300 mamsl on one of the lakes at the Khumbu Glacier.[11] But the high water flow had its downside — many parts were too dangerous and had to be omitted; the result was that just two boats out of eleven survived to the end at the confluence with Sun Kosi. It is unclear which parts of the river were skipped, but the descent is generally considered incomplete.[12] The next year, HTV documentary movie "Dudh Kosi: Relentless River of Everest" was released which is a source of common misconception that this was the first trip on the river.</p>

            <p>Uttarakhand (Hindi: Uttarākhaṇḍa, pronounced [ˈʊt̪ːəɾaːkʰəɳɖᵊ], lit. 'Northern Land'), also known as Uttaranchal (English: /ˌʊtəˈræntʃʌl/; the official name until 2007),[22] is a state in northern India. The state is bordered by Himachal Pradesh to the northwest, Tibet to the north, Nepal to the east, Uttar Pradesh to the south and southeast, with a small part touching Haryana in the west. Uttarakhand has a total area of 53,483 km2 (20,650 sq mi), equal to 1.6% of the total area of India. Dehradun serves as the state capital, with Nainital being the judicial capital. The state is divided into two divisions, Garhwal and Kumaon, with a total of 13 districts. The forest cover in the state is 45.4% of the state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 16% of the total geographical area. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and its tributary Yamuna, originate from the Gangotri and Yamunotri glaciers respectively. Ranked 6th among the Top 10 Greenest States in India with Best AQI.[23]

Uttarakhand's history dates back to prehistoric times, with archaeological evidence showcasing human habitation. It was part of the ancient Kuru and the Panchal kingdoms during the Vedic age, and later saw the rise of dynasties like the Kunindas and influence of Buddhism as evidenced by Ashokan edicts. Though primarily driven by agriculture and hydropower, the state's economy is now dominated by the service industry. The service sector comprises primarily travel, tourism, and hotel industry. The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Uttarakhand is ₹3.78 lakh crore (US$45 billion). The state contributes five seats to the lower house Lok Sabha [24] and three seats to the upper house Rajya Sabha.
